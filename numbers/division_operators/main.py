# Calculate the number of completed transactions
completed = 60 // 7
# Calculate the number of remaining minutes
minutes = 60 % 7 

# Print these values
print("The number of completed transactions is", completed)
print("The number of remaining minutes is", minutes)


# really useful for quick practical division scenarios 


# departments = 38000 // 7000
# print(departments)  # output: 5

# really practical example for when you need to understand the remaining amount avaialble 
# remaining_budget = 38000 % 7000
# print(remaining_budget)  # output: 3000
